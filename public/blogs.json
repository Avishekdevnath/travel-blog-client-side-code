        "description": "Our airboat zig zagged over eelgrasses and aquatic plants and past startled alligators on the Wacissa River, Florida. Savannah clutched my arm with a mixture of terror and exhilaration on her face. I grinned and whooped back at her, “This is so awesome!!” Adventuring down the Wacissa River was one of the last adventures on our week long road trip of Natural North Florida, filled with memorable Florida adventures like kayaking to offshore islands in Cedar Key and free diving for sea scallops in Steinhatchee. Come with us down below as we journey down the Wacissa River, first on a magical airboat tour, and finishing with a technical and thrilling kayak paddle through the historical Slave Canal. We rate this as one of the most fun things to do in Florida with kids, and one of our most spectacular outdoor adventures in the USA. Note: we visited on a paid campaign with Visit Florida, and in partnership with Natural North Florida. All images and words are our own! As we walked up to the air boat at the beginning of our trip at Wacissa River Springs, I was magnetically drawn to gaze in wonder at the view in front of me. A dense, tropical canopy bordered a large body of crystal clear river covered with water hyacinths and bright green lilies. Kayakers slowly paddled up the river, almost as if in a slow motion dream and a rope dangled from an ancient cypress tree where kids launched themselves giggling into the water.",

        "description": "After experiencing many of the fun things to do in Outer Banks and its natural beauty, we can report that this destination is just heaven. There’s over 100-miles of some of the best beaches in North Carolina and so much of it you can have to yourself, or at least enough room to spread your large blue sunshade. Full of enough adventure, history, water sports and culture to keep you from getting bored, but not too much to distract you from quiet moments spent appreciating natural beauty. Because it sure does have a lot of that. It’s just another reason we love living here in North Carolina. The Outer Banks (OBX) is a 130-mile stretch of barrier islands just off the coast of North Carolina, from Corolla in the north to Ocracoke in the South. And then there is the Southern part of the Outer Banks, the Crystal Coast. Like Wrightsville Beach, it has the ocean on one side and the sound on the opposite side of the coastline offering even more opportunity for water activities. The Outer Banks is only a three-hour drive from our home in Raleigh, making it the perfect getaway for any season, and for any length of time! We recently visited for a three-night stay and discovered many amazing things to do in the OBX, including some of the highlights, and a few hidden secrets.",

        "description": "There was a different level of excitement or anticipation on this ski trip to Idaho. An unnerving, fluttering feeling that comes when diving into a true UNKNOWN. From big cities to jungle treks, African safaris, off-roading adventures, and beach paradises around the world, there is not much I haven’t done. After 23 years of making travel my life, I now embark on most trips with is a sense of knowing and assurance. I may be visiting a new place name, but I have a strong understanding of what is to come. On this Idaho skiing trip to three North Idaho ski resorts there was none of that. I was thrown back into the world of a brand-new traveler, and I loved it. Excitement and wonder were intermingled with a fear – how would we all fare down those slippery slopes? Most importantly, how would I cope in the cold temperatures in these ski destinations? There was only one way to find out. Buy the warm snow clothes, boot up, and join a ski lesson! Winter takes on a different shade of meaning when you’re walking down the main street of a village at the base of the mountain you’re about to ski down. It no longer becomes that freezing air that chills my bones and makes me moan, it breathes a freshness and beauty that beckons me to play.",

We were hosted by the railroad, but for you I would also recommend First Class. The good news is it's only $20 extra than a regular ticket and I think well worth the price. In the First Class carriage you get appetizers, champagne toast upon arrival, access to a cash bar, and comfy seats large enough to lie down on - not just for the children; I spied a few adults resting after a couple of glasses of wine! That's the style and pace of the Verde Canyon Railroad. After a week of challenging hikes in Sedona and thrilling off-road adventures, we LOVED the opportunity to enjoy the beauty of the canyon without having to walk, climb, drive, or hold on tight. We could even enjoy a glass of wine and a toasty winter blaster liquor coffee while doing it. And I could actually wear jeans, a pretty top, and my favorite cowgirl boots!

        "description": "I can’t say scalloping in Florida was ever on our bucket list for USA travel experiences. We never even knew it existed until we did a Natural North Florida road trip last summer and it was on our itinerary. Even though, we had no idea what it entailed we’re always up for any kind of adventure. The more unique the adventure the better. Not only did it help tell the story of the Florida Gulf Coast region we were visiting, but it also pushed us out of our comfort zone to learn a new skill, and have a blast while doing it. The girls were nervous about going out into the ocean to do this. There was a lot of grumbling (which happens often before any adventure), and a bit of coaxing was needed to get them in the water, but once we did, we couldn’t get them out…“This is the most fun ever!” they cried when our Florida scalloping adventure was finally over. We arrived in Steinhatchee River after our short stay in the fantastic Cedar Key. We discovered a delightful region centered on this short, undeveloped black river in the Big Bend region of Florida. It’s the kind of place I felt I could stay for several days enjoying the slow pace and the recreational activities on the river. Signs out the front of our hotel warned “Slow movement. Manatees around!“ How cool to be sitting in the hotel riverside garden area and see one of Florida’s favorite wildlife species swim on by. If you’re lucky you may see an alligator or two!",

        "description": "I found it strange that no one from our community had recommended the Verde Canyon Railroad as one of the top things to do in Sedona. We had so many other tips that were spot on including dinner at Elote Café, hiking the Devil's Bridge, the Pink Jeep tour, and all the fantastic vortex hikes. I only knew about the Verde Canyon Railroad experience when I popped into the visitor center to get a Sedona map. I overhead a staff member telling a couple about the train trip and mentioning that it was not only one of the top Sedona attractions and things to do in Arizona, but one of the top four attractions in the USA! We were hosted by the railroad, but for you I would also recommend First Class. The good news is it's only $20 extra than a regular ticket and I think well worth the price. In the First Class carriage you get appetizers, champagne toast upon arrival, access to a cash bar, and comfy seats large enough to lie down on - not just for the children; I spied a few adults resting after a couple of glasses of wine! That's the style and pace of the Verde Canyon Railroad. After a week of challenging hikes in Sedona and thrilling off-road adventures, we LOVED the opportunity to enjoy the beauty of the canyon without having to walk, climb, drive, or hold on tight. We could even enjoy a glass of wine and a toasty winter blaster liquor coffee while doing it. And I could actually wear jeans, a pretty top, and my favorite cowgirl boots! Sometimes it's nice to dress up after days in the wilderness.",
